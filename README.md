## Overview

- A small project to demonstrate the different types of sorting algorithms and how they work.
- For now there are only three sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort and Selection Sorting.
- In the end you can see the time that each algorithm took to sort the same array.

## Getting started

- Run `yarn start` or `npm start` or `node index.js`
- Wait for the script to run
- See the result (in _milliseconds_) that each algorithm took to sort.
